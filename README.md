SysAdminBoard
=======================

SysAdminBoard is a simple dashboard system written in Python, HTML and Javascript and served on a simple [CherryPy Webserver](http://cherrypy.org/) (included).  It was originally written to reformat snmp data for the [Panic Statusboard iPad App](http://www.panic.com/Statusboard/), but has since become a fully stand-alone project that can grab data from a variety of sources and render charts and graphs in a web browser.

Here is an older photo our installation.  We use some small ASUS chromeboxes along with the [Chrome Kiosk extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kiosk/afhcomalholahplbjhnmahkoekoijban?hl=en) to display our dashboards.

## Features
### VMware vSphere ESX Host Monitoring
This module will talk to a VMware vSphere vCenter server using VMware APIs to get data about ESX hosts.  Items are sorted based on top CPU usage over a 30 minute period.

### Network Bandwidth Monitoring

This module demonstrates how to grab network bandwidth data.  In the first image, it is pulling in snmp data from a Palo Alto Firewall.  In the second image, it is pulling snmp data some VLANs on a Cisco Catalyst 6880 switch.

### SNMP Network Monitoring

This module demonstrates how to grab SNMP table data.  In this case, it is pulling in ISDN values from a Cisco Voice Gateway to show the number of active phone calls.

### SNMP Temperature Gadget

This module talks to a couple different APC devices to pull in temperature, humidity, voltage and runtime data.

### Exchange Monitoring

This module monitors a Microsoft Exchange server to display SMTP message totals for the day along with RPC and latency information (per CAS server).  Note that this code requires my [pyPerfmon](https://github.com/flakshack/pyPerfmon) app running on each Exchange server to be monitored.

### Weather

This is a simple javascript-only weather gadget that pulls data from [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org).  If you use this gadget, please sign up for a free APPID on that site and edit the source file to include your code.

### Clock

This is a great javascript-only clock from [YXKFW](http://www.yxkfw.com/?p=15718).

## Code Layout
This project is basically a copy of what I run in production.  You will need to edit the data module files to provide details related to your environment, for example server ip addresses and SNMP OIDs.  You will want to download a copy of the free [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) so you can step through modules as necessary to get them working in your environment.

Each data module in the system is a single python file designed to be run independently for testing.  You can run any of the python files directly and it will output data in JSON format.  When launched via the main webserver module, these data modules provide JSON data to HTML/javascript front-end pages.

You should edit the credentials.py file to store usernames and passwords.  Although the python files are hidden behind the web server, the credentials are being stored in plain text, so be sure that you are using locked down accounts with read-only privileges.  For example, a read-only VMware vSphere account is all we need.

The main module is webserver.py. This launches the CherryPy webserver and loads each data module into a separate thread.  To enable/disable a module, find the **MODULES** section and use the SysAdminBoardModule function, specifying the module filename (without the .py).  

For example this function:
```
SysAdminBoardModule('vmware_host')
```
will load the vmware_host.py data module, setup the webserver to serve the front-end HTML page (/vmware_host) and serve the json data (/vmware_host/ajax).  By default, the webserver only has the sample module enabled.

If you browse to the webserver, it will display a list of loaded modules with links to display the output appropriately (HTML and AJAX).  Note that the webserver loads on port 8080 by default unless you make the iptables changes below to redirect from port 80.

## Simple Linux Configuration
Here are some directions for a base CentOS 6 Linux server install.  (Note that these directions were updated and simplified on 12/21/2016 to account for the upgrade to Python3).

Install Python3 (note that gcc and python34-devel are required for pysnmp)

```
yum install epel-release
yum install python34 python-pip python34-devel gcc
```

Create a virtual environment in /opt/sysadminboard-ve to store the required python modules (so they don't intermingle with the normal OS python modules.)

```
pip install -U pip
pip install virtualenv
cd /opt
virtualenv -p python3 sysadminboard-ve
```

Now that the virtual environment is available, use this command anytime you want to test or run pip

```
source /opt/sysadminboard-ve/bin/activate
```

Confirm which python you're using

```
which python
```

Install modules using pip  (make sure you're in the virtualenv first using the source command above.)

```
pip install CherryPy
pip install routes
pip install pyvmomi
pip install mysql-connector
pip install requests
pip install pysnmp
```

Copy all files to /opt/sysadminboard.  Note that the default log_settings.json file is set for debugging on Mac OS X.  Replace it with the CentOS version in log_settings_samples.

Create sbpython account and assign owner rights to the static folder.  The webserver will run as this user account, so it needs rights to this folder.  All other files will be owned by root.  Be sure to mark the credentials file so other accounts cannot access it.

```
adduser sbpython
chown -R sbpython:sbpython /opt/sysadminboard/static
chmod 700 /opt/sysadminboard/credentials.py
```

There are sample syslog and logrotate files that you can copy to your system to facilitate logging.

```
cp /opt/sysadminboard/centos_install/rsyslog.d/sysadminboard.conf /etc/rsyslog.d
service rsyslog restart
cp /opt/sysadminboard/centos_install/logrotate.d/sysadminboard /etc/logrotate.d
```

Setup Service
There is a simple init.d script in the source init.d directory.  Copy the sysadminboard file to /etc/init.d/ on server

```
cp /opt/sysadminboard/centos_install/init.d/sysadminboard /etc/init.d
chmod +x /etc/init.d/sysadminboard
chkconfig sysadminboard on
```

You can run the following commands now to stop or start the service.

```
service sysadminboard start
service sysadminboard stop
service sysadminboard status
```

Note that you use the deactivate command to exit a virtual environment.  The source...activate and deactivate commands are not needed when starting the service, only when testing.

```
deactivate
```


Add these rules to your firewall to redirect from port 8080 to port 80:

```
 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
# Redirect port 80 to port 8080
Â iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080
```

* A new sample module is included and is the only module enabled by default.
* New Tintri (REST API) monitoring gadget.
